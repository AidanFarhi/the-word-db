genesis,1,1,"In the beginning, God made the heavens and the earth."
genesis,1,2,"But the earth was unseen and unprepared, and darkness was upon the deep. And the spirit of God rushed upon the water."
genesis,1,3,"And God said, ""Let light come into being."" And light came into being."
genesis,1,4,"And God saw the light, that it was good. And God made a separation between the light and the darkness."
genesis,1,5,"And God named the light day and the darkness he named night. And there was evening, and there was morning, the first day."
genesis,1,6,"And God said, ""Let a firmament come into being in the midst of the water, and let a separator be in the midst of the water."" And so it happened."
genesis,1,7,"And God made the firmament, and God made a separation in the midst of the water that was under the firmament and in the midst of the water that was upon the firmament."
genesis,1,8,"And God named the firmament heaven. And God saw that is was good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the second day."
genesis,1,9,"And God said, ""Let the water that is under the heavens be gathered together into one assembly, and let the dryness appear."" And so it happened. And the water under the heavens was brought together into their assembly, and the dryness appeared."
genesis,1,10,"And God named the dryness earth, and the assemblies of the waters he named seas. And God saw that it was good."
genesis,1,11,"And God said, ""Let the earth sprout fodder plants, sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and fruit-bearing tree making fruit whose seed is itself in the tree, according to kind in regard to likeness upon the earth."" And so it happened."
genesis,1,12,"And the earth brought forth fodder plants, sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and the fruit-bearing tree making fruit whose seed is itself in the tree, corresponding to its kind upon the earth. And God saw that it was good."
genesis,1,13,"And there was evening, and there was morning, the third day."
genesis,1,14,"And God said, ""Let luminaries come into being in the firmament of the heavens for illumination of the earth and rule the days and the nights and make a separation in the midst of the day and in the midst of the night. And let them be for a sign and for seasons and for days and for years."
genesis,1,15,"And let them be for illumination in the firmament of the heavens so that they might give light upon the earth."" And so it happened."
genesis,1,16,"And God made the two big luminaries, the big luminary to have authority over the day, and the little luminary to have authority over the night and the stars."
genesis,1,17,And God placed them in the firmament of the heavens so that they might shine upon the earth
genesis,1,18,and rule over the day and the night and to make a separation in the midst of the light and in the midst of the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
genesis,1,19,"And there was evening, and there was morning, the fourth day."
genesis,1,20,"And God said, ""Let the water bring forth living, creeping things and birds flying above the earth in relation to the firmament of the heavens."" And so it happened."
genesis,1,21,And God made the very large fish and every life of living creeping things that the water brought forth according to their kind and every bird with wings according to kind. And God saw that it was good.
genesis,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, ""Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply upon the earth."""
genesis,1,23,"And there was evening, and there was morning, the fifth day."
genesis,1,24,"And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth a living creature according to kind, quadrupeds and creeping things and wild animals of the earth according to kind."" And so it happened."
genesis,1,25,And God made the wild animals of the earth according to kind and the livestock according to kind and all the creeping things of the earth according to their kind. And God saw that it was good.
genesis,1,26,"And God said, ""Let us make humankind according to our image and according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the livestock and all the earth and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."""
genesis,1,27,And God made humankind; he made him according to the image of God; he made them male and female.
genesis,1,28,"And God blessed them, saying, ""Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and gain dominion over it, and rule over the fish of the seas and the birds of the heavens and all the livestock and all the earth and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."""
genesis,1,29,"And God said, ""Look, I have given to you every herb that has sowable seed that is upon all the earth, and every tree that has sowable seed in its fruit will become food for you,"
genesis,1,30,"and for all the wild animals of the earth and for all the birds of the heavens and for every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth that has soul of life in itself. And all green fodder will be for food."" And so it happened."
genesis,1,31,"And God saw everything that he made, and look, it was very good! And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day."
genesis,2,1,The heavens and the earth and all their ornamentation were completed.
genesis,2,2,"God completed his works that he did on the sixth day, and on the seventh day he ceased from all his works that he did."
genesis,2,3,"God blessed the seventh day and made it sacred, because on it he ceased from all his works that God began to do."
genesis,2,4,"This is the book of the origin of the heavens and the earth, when they came into being, on the day when the Lord God made the heavens and the earth,"
genesis,2,5,"and every green plant of the field before they had grown up. For God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no human to work the earth,"
genesis,2,6,but a spring came up out of the earth and watered all the face of the earth.
genesis,2,7,"And God formed the human with dust from the earth blew the breath of life into his face, and the human came into being as a living soul."
genesis,2,8,The Lord God planted a paradise in Eden toward the east and there he placed the human that he formed.
genesis,2,9,"And God further brought up from the earth every tree beautiful to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the paradise, and the tree for knowing what is known of good and of evil."
genesis,2,10,But a river goes out from Eden to water the paradise; from that place it separates into four sources.
genesis,2,11,"The name of the one is Pishon; this is the one encircling all the land of Havilah, there where the gold is."
genesis,2,12,But the gold of that land is beautiful; and the carbuncle and the green stone are there.
genesis,2,13,The name of the second river is Gihon; this is the one encircling all the land of Cush.
genesis,2,14,"The third river is the Tiris; this is the one going opposite the Assyrians. And the fourth river, this is the Euphrates."
genesis,2,15,"The Lord God took the human that he formed, and he placed him in the paradise to work and to keep it."
genesis,2,16,"The Lord God commanded Adam, saying, ""From every tree that is in the paradise you may eat for food,"
genesis,2,17,"but from the tree for knowing good and evil, you will not eat from it. And on whichever day you eat from it, you will surely die."""
genesis,2,18,"The Lord God said, ""It is not good that the human is alone; let us make for him a helper like him."""
genesis,2,19,"And God further formed from the earth all the wild animals of the field and all the birds of the heavens. And he led them to Adam to see what he would name them, and anything, whatever Adam named it as a living soul, this was its name."
genesis,2,20,"Adam gave names to all the livestock and to all the birds of the heavens and to all the wild animals of the field, yet for Adam, no helper resembling him was found."
genesis,2,21,So God laid a trance upon Adam and put him to sleep; and he took one of his ribs and filled up the flesh in the place of it.
genesis,2,22,"The Lord God built the rib that he took from Adam into a woman, and he led her to Adam."
genesis,2,23,"And Adam said, ""Now this is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; she will be named 'Woman' because she was taken from her man."""
genesis,2,24,"For this reason a man will leave behind his father and his mother and will cleave to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
genesis,3,1,"The two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and they did not feel shame. Now the serpent was wiser than all the wild animals that were upon the earth that the Lord God made. And the serpent said to the woman, ""Why is it that God said, 'You may not eat from every tree of the garden?'"""
genesis,3,2,"The woman said to the serpent, ""From every tree of the garden we may eat,"
genesis,3,3,"but from the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden God said, 'You will not eat from it, nor may you touch it, in order that you might not die.'"""
genesis,3,4,"The serpent said to the woman, ""You certainly will not die;"
genesis,3,5,"for God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be as gods who know good and evil."""
genesis,3,6,"The woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasing to the eyes to look at and it was seasonable to look at, and after taking some of its fruit, she ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and they ate."
genesis,3,7,"Then the eyes of the two were opened, and they realized that they were naked, and they sewed together fig-tree leaves and made for themselves loincloths."
genesis,3,8,"They heard the sound of the Lord God walking about in the garden in the evening, and both Adam and his wife hid from the face of the Lord God in the middle of the tree of the garden."
genesis,3,9,"And Lord God summoned Adam and said to him, ""Adam, where are you?"""
genesis,3,10,"He said to him, ""I heard the sound of you walking about in the garden, and I was afraid because I am naked, and I hid."""
genesis,3,11,"He said to him, ""Who told you that you are naked? Unless you have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you 'From this one alone, do not eat.'"""
genesis,3,12,"Adam said, ""The woman with me, whom you gave, she gave me something from the tree, and I ate."""
genesis,3,13,"The Lord God said to the woman, ""What is this you have done?"" The woman said, ""The serpent deceived me, and I ate."""
genesis,3,14,"The Lord God said to the serpent, ""Because you have done this, accursed are you of all the livestock and of all the wild animals of the earth. You will go upon your chest and belly, and you will eat earth all the days of your life."
genesis,3,15,"I will place enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he will watch your head carefully, and you will watch his heel carefully."""
genesis,3,16,"He said to the woman, ""Multiplying, I will multiply your pain and your moaning. You will bring forth children in pain, and your recourse will be to your husband, and he will be master over you."""
genesis,3,17,"And he said to Adam, ""Because you obeyed the voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which I commanded you, 'From only this one, do not eat,' you ate from that one, the earth is accursed by your works. In pain you will eat it all the days of your life."
genesis,3,18,Thorns and thistles will grow up for you. You will eat the herbs of the field.
genesis,3,19,"You will eat your bread by the sweat of your face until you return into the earth from which you were taken; because you are earth, and you will depart into the earth."""
genesis,3,20,"Adam called the name of the woman Zoe, because she was mother of all the living."
genesis,3,21,"The Lord God made tunics of skin for Adam and his wife, and he put them on them."
genesis,3,22,"And the Lord God said, ""Look, Adam has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; so now may he never stretch out his hand and take from the tree of life and eat, and will live forever."""
genesis,3,23,So the Lord God sent him away from the luxurious garden to work the earth from which he was taken.
genesis,3,24,"So he threw Adam out and settled him opposite the luxurioius garden and stationed the cherubim and the flaming, turning sword to guard the way to the tree of life."
genesis,4,1,"And Adam knew Eve, his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain and said, ""I have acquired a man through God."""
genesis,4,2,"And she proceeded to bring forth his brother, Abel. Abel became a herdsman of sheep, and Cain was working the earth."
genesis,4,3,"Now this happened after a number of days: Cain brought some of the fruit of the earth as an offering for the Lord,"
genesis,4,4,"and Abel himself also brought some of the firstborn of his sheep and some of their hard fat parts. God looked upon Abel and upon his gifts,"
genesis,4,5,"but he did not pay attention to Cain and upon his offerings. He grieved Cain very much, and he fell in face."
genesis,4,6,"The Lord God said to Cain, ""Why have you become deeply grieved, and why has your face fallen?"
genesis,4,7,"Have you not sinned if you offer rightly but do not divide rightly? Calm down! His recourse will be to you, and you will rule him."""
genesis,4,8,"And Cain said to Abel, his brother, ""Let's walk through the field."" And this happened while they were in the field: Cain rose against Abel, his brother, and he killed him."
genesis,4,9,"Then God said to Cain, ""Where is Abel, your brother?"" But he said, ""I don't know. I'm not my brother's guardian, am I?"""
genesis,4,10,"God said, ""What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the earth."
genesis,4,11,"Now, accursed are you upon the earth, which opened its mouth wide to receive the blood of your brother from your hand,"
genesis,4,12,"because you will work the earth; it will not proceed to give its strength to you. You will moan and tremble upon the earth."""
genesis,4,13,"Cain said to the Lord, ""My guilt is too great for me to be forgiven."
genesis,4,14,"If you throw me out today from the face of the earth, and I will be hidden from your face, then I will be moaning and trembling upon the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me."""
genesis,4,15,"The Lord God said to him, ""It will not be like that. Anyone who kills Cain will release seven reprisals. The Lord God has placed a sign for Cain so that none who find him would kill him."""
genesis,4,16,"Cain went out from the face of God and lived in the land of Nod, opposite Eden."
genesis,4,17,"Cain knew his wife, and once she conceived she brought forth Enoch. He was building a city and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch."
genesis,4,18,"Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech."
genesis,4,19,"Lamech took two wives for himself; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah."
genesis,4,20,Adah brought forth Jabal. This man was the father of cattle raisers who live in tents.
genesis,4,21,The name of his brother was Jubal. This man was the one who invented the harp and lyre.
genesis,4,22,"Zillah brought forth — even she — Tubal-cain, and he was a hammer-using coppersmith of copper and of iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah."
genesis,4,23,"Lamech said to his wives:

      ""Adah and Zillah, hear my voice,
         wives of Lamech, give ear to my words,
      because I killed a man for a wound to me
         and a young man for a bruise to me,"
genesis,4,24,"      because sevenfold revenge has been given to Cain,
         but from Lamech seventy times seven.""
"
genesis,4,25,"Adam knew Eve, his wife, and, once she conceived, she brought forth a son and called his name Seth, saying, ""Because God raised up another offspring for me in the place of Abel, whom Cain killed."""
genesis,4,26,"Seth had a son, and he called his name Enosh. This one hoped to invoke the name of the Lord God."
